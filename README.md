EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ is a lightweight plugin for parallelization of EasyVVUQ (https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ)
with the QCG-PilotJob mechanism (https://github.com/vecma-project/QCG-PilotJob).

It is developed as part of VECMA (http://www.vecma.eu), and is part of the VECMA Toolkit (http://www.vecma-toolkit.eu).

The tool provides API that can be effortlessly integrated into typical EasyVVUQ workflows to enable parallel processing
of demanding operations, in particular the simulation model's executions and encodings.
It works regardless if you run your use-case on multi-core laptop or on large HPC machine.


## Requirements

The software requires Python 3.6+ for usage.

Moreover, since EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ is a wrapper over EasyVVUQ and QCG-PilotJob, you need to have
both these packages available in your environment. You can install them with pip in the following way:
```
$ pip3 install easyvvuq
$ pip3 install qcg-pilotjob
```

## Installation

The software could be easily installed from the PyPi repository:
```
$ pip3 install easyvvq-qcgpj
```

Alternatively, if you want to use specific branch of the software, 
you can get it from the the github repository. The procedure is quite typical, e.g.:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vecma-project/EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ.git
$ cd EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ
$ git checkout some_branch
$ pip3 install .
```
